# ðŸ“Œ bash

Sometimes we need to work with remote servers that don't have any graphic interface. In this case it's good to be able to use bash commands. They allow us to perform regular actions such as creating, editing, deleting files and folders though CLI. 

I am happy to share some bash commands that I used to do tasks during my Quality Assurance studies.

## Task 1

##### Working with files and directories
```bash
~                                     # Home directory 
pwd                                   # Show current directory path
mkdir test1                           # Create a directory named test1
cd test1                              # Go to directory test1 (also possible to write the path to needed directory)
touch file{1,2,3}.txt.                # Create file 1,2 and 3 inside directory test1
ls                                    # Check directory test1 content (ls -la if there are any hidden files) 
cd                                    # Go home directory 
mkdir test2                           # Create directory test2 inside home directory
rmdir test2                           # Delete directory test2 
cd mv ~/test1                         # Go back to directory test1
rm file2.txt                          # Delete file 2 
mkdir test3                           # Create directory test3
touch file{4,5}.txt                   # Add two files to directory test3
cd ..                                 # Go back to parent directory
rmdir -rf test3                       # Delete directory test3  
ls                                    # Make sure directory test3 was deleted
mkdir test4                           # Create directory test4
mv ~/test1/file{1,3}.txt ~/test4      # Move file1.txt and file3.txt from directory test1 to directory test4
echo line11 >> file1.txt              # Add 3 lines to file1.txt
echo line12 >> file1.txt            
echo line13 >> file1.txt
cat file1.txt                         # Check content of file1.txt
echo line31 >> file3.txt              # Add 3 lines to file3.txt
echo line32 >> file3.txt
echo line33 >> file3.txt
cat file1.txt file3.txt               # Check contents of file1.txt and file3.txt at once
nano file1.txt + manual replacement   # Using one of the editors, replace all lines in file1.txt and file3.txt
nano file3.txt + manual replacement 
```
## Task 2
##### Editing files, checking and killing proccesses, pinging websites
```bash
mkdir test3                                   # Create directory test3 
cd test3                                      # Open directory test3 
echo -e "row1\nrow2\nrow3\nrow4" > file4.txt  # Add 3 files to test3, each of which should contain 4 lines
echo -e "row1\nrow2\nrow3\nrow4" > file5.txt  
echo -e "row1\nrow2\nrow3\nrow4" > file6.txt 
grep "row2" file5.txt                         # Find the line "row2" in file5.txt 
grep -R "row" .                               # Find the line "row" in the test3 directory
grep -c "row" file6.txt                       # Count number of lines containing word "row" in file6.txt
find . -name "file5.txt"                      # Find file5.txt in test3 directory
find . -name "file5.txt" -delete              # Using find command delete file5.txt
echo test > file4.txt                         # Using the echo command, add the word "test" to file4.txt
sed 's/test/fail/g' file4.txt                 # Change the word "test" in file4.txt to "fail"
echo test >> file4.txt                        # Add the word "test" to file4.txt so that the content is preserved
ps aux                                        # View all processes in the system
kill 666                                      # Kill process 666 in console
